## Purpose
- Create an ER scheduling program using a min-heap organized by patient triage level. Calls in patients with the lowest triage level (most urgent) first. It allows the user to add a patient to the waiting list, change a patient's triage status, discharge a patient, call in a patient, check which rooms are empty, or print out the waiting list.
## Triage Levels
- Level 1 (resuscitation): requires immediate, life-saving intervention and includes patients with cardiopulmonary arrest, major trauma, severe  respiratory distress, and seizures. 
- Level 2 (emergent): requires an immediate nursing assessment and rapid treatment and includes patients who are in a high-risk situation, are  confused, lethargic, or disoriented, or have severe pain or distress, including  patients with stroke, head injuries, asthma, and sexual-assault injuries.
- Level 3 (urgent): includes patients who need quick attention but can wait as long as 30 minutes for assessment and treatment and includes patients with signs of infection, mild respiratory distress, or moderate pain.
- Level 4: less urgent
- Level 5: non urgent
